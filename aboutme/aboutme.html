    <p>I am a senior at the Mayfield highschool in Ohio. I am in multiple activities, I am part of the cross country team in the fall, 
    indoor track and ski club in the winter, and part of the track/field team in the spring. When I am not participating in on these 
    activites, I am either watching shows, hanging out with friends, or playing video games. My favorite food is any type of noodles
    and my favorite songs would be ones that are catchy.</p>
