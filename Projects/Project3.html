      <h1>HTML, GitHub and Web Dev</h1>
        <p style="font-size:25px;"  "border:1px;" "black padding:30px;>For these couple of weeks we have been learning about html. We spent about a week learning about html
        through multiple websites such as w3schools. We then created a github account, where we could work on our
        websites and share it with the public. Our first major project was to create a website that would link to 
        an about me section and the projects I have worked on in my engineering class.
