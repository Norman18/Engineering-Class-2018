      <h1>Foot Ball Data</h1>
        <p>In the first couple weeks of my engineering class we analyzed the football games that were provided to us by Mr.Verdi.
        With the information he provided, everyone in the class made their own automated processing system for the data. Each 
        person evaluated something different with the data to find if there was a correlation between some plays.
