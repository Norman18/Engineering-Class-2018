      <p style="font-size:25px;"  "border:1px;" "black padding:30px;>As we continued to explore the automated process for the football data we then
      started to look into 2d designs. We learned how to convert a raster image into a vector image.
      After making it into a vecctor we were able to laser cut our designs out of cardboard. We then 
      were able to make vinyl stickers out of the vector images we used for the laser cut out, to stick 
      to our chrome books.
