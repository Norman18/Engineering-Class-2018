      <p style="font-size:25px;"  "border:1px;" "black padding:30px;>As we continued to explore the automated process for the football data we then
      started to look into 2d designs. We learned how to convert a raster image into a vector image.
      After making it into a vecctor we were able to laser cut our designs out of cardboard. We then 
      were able to make vinyl stickers out of the vector images we used for the laser cut out to stick 
      to our chrome books. The process of converting it into a vector image wasn't that hard, it mainly was making sure everything was
      dimenioned correctly, because the laser engraver was very nit picky on that.
