      <p style="font-size:25px;"  "border:1px;" "black padding:30px;>For these past couple weeks, we have been working on 3D designs.
      I have been presonally using autodesk inventor for all my 3D designing. I created a 3D printable chain link for my major assignment
      in my class. In the few weeks we spent learning how to make 3D designs I learned how to use many of the features of autodesk inventor.
