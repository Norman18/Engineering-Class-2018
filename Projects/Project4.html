      <p style="font-size:25px;"  "border:1px;" "black padding:30px;>For these past couple weeks, we have been working on 3D designs.
      I have been presonally using autodesk inventor for all my 3D designing. I created a 3D printable chain link for my major assignment
      in my class. In the few weeks we spent learning how to make 3D designs I learned how to use many of the features of autodesk inventor
      such as the revolve, loft, chamber, and assembly. Learning how to 3D design made it easier to print an object that would rather be hard to make 
      by hand. This also helps me more, because I want to go to college for engineering, so learning a few tricks before I get there helps a lot.
