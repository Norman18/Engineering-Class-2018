      <p style="font-size:25px;"  "border:1px;" "black padding:30px;>For these past couple weeks, we have been working on 3D designs.
      There are many websites that could be used to design such as fusion 360, blender, or autodesk inventor.
      I have been presonally using autodesk inventor for all my 3D designing. I created a 3D printable chain link for my major assignment
      in my class. In the few weeks we spent learning how to make 3D designs I learned how to use many of the features of autodesk inventor
      such as the revolve, loft, chamber, and assembly. Learning how to 3D design made it easier to print objects that would rather be hard to make 
      by hand. I really enjoyed this experience since I love designing. For some reason I really enjoy desinging anything, since I can create anything 
      that comes to my mind.
