      <p style="font-size:25px;"  "border:1px;" "black padding:30px;>For these couple of weeks we have been learning about circuits.
      We used the arduino uno, which is the most simple circuit board. We also learned about some commands for coding the arduino such
      as digitalRead() or digitalWrite() which code for the LED lights that we used. We spent a couple weeks playing around with the circuits by creating light shows 
      and setting up buttons. Overall we learned how to code the for the LED lights usig all sorts of commands.
